1. Consider a bookshelf where there is one slot per book.
   There is a librarian whose job it is to shelve books on this bookshelf,
   and the librarian refuses to put more than one book in a slot even if there
   is extra space.
   What are some potential downsides to this system?

2. The librarian decides to remove the slots.
   There is now just an open shelf (of finite size) for books to be placed on.
   Books are always coming and going,
   and they are not alphabetized or placed in any particular order --
   the only goal is to get as many books on the shelf as possible at a time.
    * Does removing the slots make the system easier or harder for the
      librarian? Why?
    * Do you expect that more or fewer books will be able to fit on average?

3. Assume that when working with the second system,
   the librarian at some point has a lot of gaps left in the bookshelf.
   What might they do to make their life a bit easier and the system more
   efficient?
