## Sickness Policies

If you are sick,
please do not come to class, lab, or office hours.
Just let me know,
and we will figure out a way for you to make up any missed work.
Previous lecture videos are linked to from the course homepage.
While these are not in general a substitute for coming to class,
they can be a good replacement in an instance where you are feeling unwell.

## Course Objectives

  relative performance.
* describe filesystem implementation and storage space management.

## Course Policies

* All assignments must be submitted to Prairielearn and are due at 11:59 PM EST
  on the due date.
  Some assignments will require drawing diagrams that must be uploaded to
  Prairielearn.
  If you do not have convenient access to a scanner,
  there are free document scanning apps available,
  such as the Google Drive app.
  I reserve the right to specify alternate submission cutoffs per assignment.
* No late assignments will be accepted.
  In cases of extreme emergency, such as an accident or illness resulting in
  hospitalization, please contact me and I will be reasonable.
* Assignments are to be completed individually unless directed otherwise.
  You may discuss the assignments with other students,
  but every student is expected to submit his or her own work.
  If you find yourself emailing code or written solutions to another student,
  even "for reference", you are violating this policy.
* Exams will not be rescheduled unless in extreme emergencies.
  If you have a question about this, please ask me.
  The exception to this is if an exam falls during a religious observence that
  would not allow you to participate in the exam.
